# 🧠 Lucid – A Mindful Study Companion

> 🏆 **Distinguished Winner – Swift Student Challenge 2025**

Lucid helps students tackle academic procrastination by promoting emotional awareness and reducing anxiety—through mindful interaction, persuasive design, and a focused user experience.

## ✨ What is Lucid?

**Lucid** is a study companion designed for students who struggle with procrastination. It leverages emotional management techniques and persuasive design to reduce anxiety and help users stay engaged with their academic tasks.

Inspired by real psychological research, Lucid turns the fight against procrastination into a guided, emotionally-aware journey.

## 💡 Why Lucid?

Lucid wasn’t just built to solve a problem — it was built out of personal experience.

Like many students, I’ve struggled with procrastination. That familiar cycle of anxiety, avoidance, and last-minute rushes has followed me for years. Ironically, I finished building Lucid during an all-nighter — but that only made the project more real. I was building something I genuinely needed.

Studies show that procrastination often stems from poor emotional regulation. When faced with a task that feels overwhelming, we tend to avoid it in search of short-term relief. But that relief only feeds the cycle.

Lucid was designed to help break that cycle — to:

- Reduce anxiety tied to academic pressure  
- Help students understand and manage their emotions  
- Turn study time into a reflective, structured, and more rewarding experience  

Designing Lucid helped me confront my own procrastination. That alone made this project worth building.

## 📚 What I Wanted to Learn

Building Lucid was not just about solving a problem — it was also a chance to grow as a developer and designer.

Some of the goals I had in mind:

- **Design exploration**: I wanted to experiment with a visual style inspired by **VisionOS** and **glassmorphism**, aiming for a clean and calming interface that supports focus without distractions.
- **Custom components**: With the design approach I chose, I ended up building most UI components from scratch instead of relying on default elements, which helped me learn how to write clean, reusable code.
- **Smooth animations**: I paid extra attention to transitions and interactions, with the goal of keeping everything soft and fluid.
- **Mindful UX**: I wanted to understand how emotional awareness could be woven into the user experience, not just as a feature, but as a feeling that runs through the whole flow.

These choices shaped how the app looks and feels — and also taught me a lot along the way.

Studies show that procrastination often comes from a struggle to manage emotions. When faced with a task that feels overwhelming, it’s easy to avoid it —seeking relief from the anxiety or discomfort that comes with it. But this avoidance only deepens the procrastination cycle. Lucid was designed to break that cycle by creating an environment where students can acknowledge their feelings and focus only on what’s directly ahead, helping them avoid the anxiety that so often damages productivity.

When a user opens the app, they see a list of all their “Study Projects,” representing individual academic tasks like exams or assignments. To reduce stress, due dates are hidden until they’re imminent, rather than constantly looming in the background. The user breaks down each project into simple, manageable steps. To prevent feeling overwhelmed, the app only shows the next step, letting the user focus only on what’s immediately in front of them.

When the user is ready to begin, they start a “Study Session” and are prompted to reflect on how they’re feeling. This serves a dual purpose: it helps them track their mood while studying and, more importantly, it encourages them to understand why they feel a certain way about the task. This act of emotional awareness provides the brain with a more engaging experience than avoidance, turning the process of understanding emotions into a rewarding activity. By increasing self-awareness, the app helps users break the procrastination cycle. Additionally, the user selects the duration of the session, and a timer is displayed, offering a sense of accomplishment and reward when they stay focused and avoid procrastination.

But studying isn’t just about pushing through nonstop. The app knows that breaks are essential for maintaining productivity and mental clarity. So, for longer sessions, the app gently reminds users to take breaks and ensures they return to their work with a notification system, keeping the workflow balanced and stress-free.

I used the SwiftUI framework for the interface and the animations, while also using UIKit for a custom blur effect. For the data storage SwiftData was employed, guaranteeing data persistence. Finally UserNotifications was used to push local notifications to the user.
